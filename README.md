## Battleship
Implementations of different Battleship Game AIs
- m_random.py : A random agent. Very basic. Doesn't even check if a position has been bombed before.
- m_hunt_target.py: A slightly smarter agent. Targets the surrounding positions after scoring a hit.
- m_qlearning.py : An attempt at using Reinforcement Learning for this problem. Doesn't work very well yet.
- m_convnet.py: A supervised learning approach that works quite well.
